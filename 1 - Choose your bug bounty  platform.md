# Immunefi üõ°Ô∏è

## 1. Why Immunefi?

They didn't pay me to say that but: I've chosen **Immunefi** because they are the **biggest platform** specializing in **Web3 bug bounties**.  
The rewards are attractive, and their **Vaults system** provides assurance: companies lock funds upfront to show they are serious about paying hunters who find vulnerabilities.  
This makes the ecosystem much more trustworthy for security researchers.

## 2. Onboarding pro tips

Getting started on Immunefi was very simple:  
- Created an account with basic information  
- Connected my crypto wallet  
- Entered a few personal details (because I also want to participate in **KYC-required bug bounties** ‚Äî though it's optional, as many programs allow **anonymous submissions**)  

Once that's done, you're ready ‚Äî in theory, you can start hunting bugs immediately!

## 3. How to Choose a Bug Bounty

As a beginner in bug bounty programs, I look for scopes that are **small and manageable**‚Äîideally projects with **just one or two smart contracts**. This helps me:

- **Stay focused** on understanding contract logic without feeling overwhelmed  
- **Complete a full audit** exercise from start to finish, building confidence  
- **Get quicker feedback** and learn patterns of common Web3 vulnerabilities  

Once comfortable, I gradually expand to larger scopes and multi-contract systems.

## 4. My Tips for Immunefi

### 4.0 Don't waste time to read everything
- If you want, like me,  to focus on contracts just lock-in, and learn everything you can on solidity before moving on, don't waste time learning Immunefi classification system or how to report vulnerabilities because it's highly likely you will not find anything for your first 2 months, so lock-in learn as much as you can, experiment, create and once you the time comes write how to reports your vulnerabilities correctly.

### 4.1 Know the Rules  
- **Read the program policy** carefully. Every bounty has its own ‚Äúallowed vs. disallowed‚Äù actions.  
- **Don‚Äôt disclose** any vulnerabilities until they‚Äôre officially resolved‚Äîpremature disclosure can violate terms.  
- **Avoid mainnet testing** of exploits; stick to testnets or dry runs, or you risk being banned.

### 4.2 Write a Stellar Report  
- **Include impact analysis**: explain how much funds or reputation the vulnerability could jeopardize.  
- **Provide a clear Proof of Concept (PoC)**: if you find a bug but can‚Äôt demonstrate it, your report may be undervalued.  
- **Follow Immunefi‚Äôs report guidelines**:
