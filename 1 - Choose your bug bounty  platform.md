## 1. Why Immunefi?

I've chosen **Immunefi** because they are the **biggest platform** specializing in **Web3 bug bounties**.  
The rewards are attractive, and their **Vaults system** provides assurance: companies lock funds upfront to show they are serious about paying hunters who find vulnerabilities.  
This makes the ecosystem much more trustworthy for security researchers.

## 2. Onboarding

Getting started on Immunefi was very simple:  
- Created an account with basic information  
- Connected my crypto wallet  
- Entered a few personal details (because I also want to participate in **KYC-required bug bounties** ‚Äî though it's optional, as many programs allow **anonymous submissions**)  

Once that's done, you're ready ‚Äî in theory, you can start hunting bugs immediately!

## 3. How to Choose a Bug Bounty

As a beginner in bug bounty programs, I look for scopes that are **small and manageable**‚Äîideally projects with **just one or two smart contracts**. This helps me:

- **Stay focused** on understanding contract logic without feeling overwhelmed  
- **Complete a full audit** exercise from start to finish, building confidence  
- **Get quicker feedback** and learn patterns of common Web3 vulnerabilities  

Once comfortable, I gradually expand to larger scopes and multi-contract systems.

## 4. My Tips for Immunefi

### 4.1 Know the Rules  
- **Read the program policy** carefully. Every bounty has its own ‚Äúallowed vs. disallowed‚Äù actions.  
- **Don‚Äôt disclose** any vulnerabilities until they‚Äôre officially resolved‚Äîpremature disclosure can violate terms.  
- **Avoid mainnet testing** of exploits; stick to testnets or dry runs, or you risk being banned.

### 4.2 Write a Stellar Report  
- **Include impact analysis**: explain how much funds or reputation the vulnerability could jeopardize.  
- **Provide a clear Proof of Concept (PoC)**: if you find a bug but can‚Äôt demonstrate it, your report may be undervalued.  
- **Follow Immunefi‚Äôs report guidelines**:
