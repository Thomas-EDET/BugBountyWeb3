## Testing Phases Classification

### Phase 1: Local Environment Setup

- **Forking chain**: Create a local environment mirroring mainnet
- **Mock creation**: Creating test fixtures and mock contracts if needeed. I actually like to test basic read functions first.

### Phase 2: Automated Static Analysis

- **Static analysis with Slither**: First-pass vulnerability detection
- **Bytecode analysis**: Verification of compiled code

### Phase 3: Dynamic Analysis

- **Unit testing**: Basic functionality verification
- **Testing deployed contracts**: Integration and deployed contract interaction
- **Invariant testing with Echidna**: Property-based testing
- **Fuzzing**: Randomized input testing

### Phase 4: Advanced Analysis

- **Symbolic execution with Mythril**: Deep path exploration
- **Formal verification**: Mathematical proofs of correctness 

## Missing Important Elements

1. **Control flow analysis**: Mapping function call sequences and execution paths
2. **Gas optimization testing**: Testing contract efficiency and gas usage
3. **Trace analysis**: Examining execution traces for anomalies
4. **Scenario testing**: Testing specific attack scenarios based on previous exploits
5. **Cross-contract interaction testing**: Testing how contracts interact with each other
6. **Mutation testing**: Introducing small changes to see if tests catch the issues
