# Web3 Learning Roadmap 

As a complete beginner in Web3, I needed a clear roadmap to become an expert as quickly as possible while delivering high-quality analysis.

I really do think it goes following those steps:

---

## 1. Understand the Basics

Get a foundational understanding of various blockchains, with a strong focus on:
- **Ethereum**
- **Layer 2 solutions (L2)**

ideas: Read bitcoin white paper. Get a bit of history, it's not ethereum but you will learn a lot.

---

## 2. Build and Deploy Smart Contracts

Jump into smart contract development:
- Write your own contracts, even if they’re imperfect
- Deploy them on testnets like **Sepolia**
- Learn how implementation works and the challenges involved

**Avoid: Using LLM for creating PoC or generate code that embed mathematics or important functions.** LLM are only generating test and deprived of reason. Really don't forget that, perhaps it will go  better but in 2025 even "advanced and code trained models" are shit"

---

## 3. Set Up Your Web3 Lab

Experiment with tools. The essential ones for starting bug bounty hunting are:

- 🛠 **Foundry** (`forge` + `anvil`)
- 🧪 **forge-std** – testing library
- 🔍 **Slither** – static analysis tool

Focusing on these will deepen your skills in open-source smart contract analysis—your gateway into bug bounties.

---

## 4. Start Small with Bug Bounties

Begin with bounty programs that have a **small scope**:
- Avoid overwhelming yourself with too many contracts at once
- Gain confidence by handling simpler codebases first

---

## 5. Learn from Real-World Examples

Make learning a daily habit:
- Review past audit reports
- Before bed, ask ChatGPT (or any chatbot) to quiz you on what you've learned, this is my prefered technics, after few days you will have learn so much.
- Reinforce **Solidity keywords** and **crypto-financial terms**

---

## 6. Document Everything

I've also created my own knowledge base:
- 🗂 **Vulnerability Database** – document flaws you've found or studied
- 🧰 **Tool Database** – record useful commands and testing techniques

Even non-critical findings help you grow.

## 7. Enjoy the Journey

If you're tech-savvy, you'll enjoy exploring and mastering Web3.  
With consistency, things will start to click and become truly rewarding.
