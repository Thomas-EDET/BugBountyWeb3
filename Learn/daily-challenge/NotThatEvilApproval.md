### Challenge approval
This challenge simulates a simplified ERC20 + approval-based vault system ‚Äî but it's hiding a dangerous vulnerability common in many real-world DeFi hacks.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

interface IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract EvilApprovalVault {
    IERC20 public immutable token;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    constructor(address _token) {
        token = IERC20(_token);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        require(amount > 0, "Zero deposit");
        require(token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount), "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        require(token.transfer(msg.sender, amount), "Withdraw failed");
    }

    function emergencyWithdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        token.approve(to, amount);
    }
}
```

#### My quick  analysis:<br>
Ok I   see multiple functions in the contract, one  to deposit, but here it's not respecting the CEI. The balances are updated after the  interaction.<br>
We  have withdraw which seems ok<br>
We have emergency withdraw, where people can use this function if they  have fund  (>0) after that it minus  the amount the person  want to emergency  withdraw to  the balance and approving.<br>
So for me TransferFrom in ERC20  is  not giving in reentrancy  as there  is  no fallback  possible therefore I  don't  think there is a reenntrancy.  The only thing weird is the emergencyWithdraw that actually not withdraw anything it only approves a certain amount  of token to be withdraw if the person  detain  funds.<br><br>

#### ChatGPT solution:<br>
An attacker (or any user) who has even a small balance can call emergencyWithdraw(attackerAddress, X). That will set

```solidity
ERC20.allowance(vault.address, attackerAddress) = X
```
Now the attacker can immediately do:
```solidity
ERC20(token).transferFrom(vault.address, attackerAddress, X);
```
and pull X tokens out of the vault.
By repeating this (or simply passing a large amount ‚â§ their own balances[msg.sender]), they can drain everyone else‚Äôs deposits too‚Äîbecause allowances are on the vault‚Äôs full token balance, not on each user‚Äôs slice.

#### Why  I  disagreed:
"But in  withdraw_ermegency  function we have require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough");.  So  I don't  understand how  can we drain  all the funds from the vault?"

####  GPT final answer:
‚úÖ The require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount) check does prevent draining more than your own balance.<br>
‚ùå The real bug is misusing approve instead of doing an actual transfer, which opens logical backdoors and mismatches between on-chain state and user expectations.<br>
üëÄ Always ask: ‚ÄúDoes this approval let me pull someone else‚Äôs tokens?‚Äù Here, thankfully, it does not‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôve correctly verified that by walking through the require logic.<br>
